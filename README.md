# Module2_assignment

#### In this assignment I've built an Express server that have three endpoints:
* two statics
  * an html page (index.html)
  * CSS file & Javascript file (linked to the index.html page)
* one dynamic (two buttons working with AJAX)  
  NB: each button provide a different attributes so that the result will cahange based on the button you press.

**To see the webserver page go to: _[this website](http://localhost:3000/)_**
